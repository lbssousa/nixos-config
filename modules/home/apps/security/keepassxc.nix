# KeePassXC — installed by default for every user (imported from
# home/common.nix) and configured as the default session Secret Service
# provider, replacing gnome-keyring (system-side removal in
# modules/system/security/yubikey.nix).
#
# The Secret Service integration registers org.freedesktop.secrets while
# KeePassXC is running, so the app must be started with the session — see
# "keepassxc" in programs.umbriel.settings.general.autostart
# (home/users/abutre/noctalia.nix). The HM-native xdg.autostart option of
# programs.keepassxc is NOT used because Umbriel only executes the
# general.autostart shell-command list and never processes
# ~/.config/autostart/*.desktop entries.

    # Three environment overrides, originally tuned for GNOME/qgnomeplatform,

    # see programs.umbriel.portalPackage in dendritic/flake/noctalia-wrapper.nix):
    #
    # 1. QT_WAYLAND_DECORATION=adwaita
    #    Draws the client-side title bar via qadwaitadecorations, which
    #    subscribes to org.freedesktop.portal.Settings' SettingChanged signal
    #    and repaints on every light/dark change — desktop-agnostic as long
    #    as the active portal implements org.freedesktop.portal.Settings.
    #
    # 2. QT_PLUGIN_PATH prefixed with qadwaitadecorations
    #    qadwaitadecorations is not a build dependency of keepassxc in
    #    nixpkgs, so its directory isn't part of the QT_PLUGIN_PATH generated
    #    by the Qt wrapper. We need to add it explicitly so Qt can find the plugin.
    #
    # 3. QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=xdgdesktopportal
    #    Delegates file dialogs and color-scheme/font/cursor settings to
    #    whatever implements the corresponding xdg-desktop-portal interfaces,
    #    instead of hardcoding a GTK/GNOME theme backend. Verify after
    #    switching that xdg-desktop-portal-umbriel/gtk cover these — if not,
    #    KeePassXC falls back to Qt's own (non-portal) file dialog and theme.
