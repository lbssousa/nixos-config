# NOTE: Home Manager configuration is managed as a NixOS module
# (home-manager.users.<name> in dendritic/flake/home-nixos-module.nix), plus
# a standalone `home-manager switch --flake .#<user>@<host>` path
# (dendritic/flake/home-configurations.nix). See home/users/<user>/home.nix
# for per-user customizations — both paths share the same module.
#
# NOTE: The full name (description) is set via the nix-secrets flake outputs
# (inputs.nix-secrets.${username}.fullName). It must not be set here.
